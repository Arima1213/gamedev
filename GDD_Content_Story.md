## 2. World Lore & Setting

### 2.1 The World of IRIFA

**Geography:**
IRIFA is a collection of floating islands suspended in an ethereal sky by ancient magic. Each island has unique biomes - forests, mountains, oceans, volcanos, ice plains - connected by mystical portals.

**History - The Age of Harmony:**
*"Thousands of years ago, the ancient Harmony civilization flourished in IRIFA. They mastered the balance between nature, magic, and technology. Using powerful Heart Gems, they stabilized the floating islands and brought prosperity."*

**The Fracture:**
*"A catastrophic event called The Fracture shattered the Heart Gems, destabilizing the islands. Most of the ancient civilization vanished. Only ruins, artifacts, and scattered survivors remain."*

**Present Day:**
*"Small communities like your town have rebuilt society. People fish, farm, mine, and explore dungeons - once ancient temples now corrupted by void energy. Legends speak of heroes who will restore the Heart Gems and save IRIFA from sinking into the void."*

### 2.2 The Void

**The Primary Antagonist:**
The Void is not a being but a force - absence of all existence. Where reality is light and substance, the Void is emptiness and entropy.

**Void Corruption:**
- Manifests as dark purple/black energy
- Corrupts creatures → Shadow variants
- Causes "Void Rifts" that spawn monsters
- Slowly consumes islands from beneath
- Stopped only by Heart Gem energy

**Void Creatures:**
- Shadow Slimes (common)
- Void Wraiths (rare)
- Corruption Golems (boss)
- Void Herald (final boss)

### 2.3 Heart Gems

**The MacGuffin:**
Seven ancient gems that stabilize reality:

1. **Heart of Earth** (Green) - Mountains/Mining
2. **Heart of Water** (Blue) - Oceans/Fishing
3. **Heart of Nature** (Gold) - Forests/Farming
4. **Heart of Fire** (Red) - Volcano/Combat
5. **Heart of Ice** (Cyan) - Frozen peaks/Taming
6. **Heart of Light** (White) - Town/Civilization
7. **Heart of Unity** (Rainbow) - Bonds all others

**Story Goal:** Find fragments, restore gems, seal the Void
