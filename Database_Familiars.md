## Usage Guidelines

### For Designers
- Use this database to balance familiar abilities
- Ensure spawn rates create appropriate rarity feel
- Design new familiars following existing patterns
- Consider taming difficulty vs power level

### For Developers
- Reference FamiliarID for spawning system
- Implement stat formulas for level scaling
- Use spawn condition data for world spawn logic
- Hook taming success calculations to this data

### For Content Updates
**Adding New Familiar Checklist:**
1. [ ] Assign unique FamiliarID
2. [ ] Determine rarity tier (affects spawn rate)
3. [ ] Define spawn conditions (location, time, weather)
4. [ ] Set base stats and scaling
5. [ ] Design abilities (combat/utility/passive)
6. [ ] Choose food preferences
7. [ ] Create 3D model and animations
8. [ ] Write lore description
9. [ ] Balance against existing familiars
10. [ ] Test taming difficulty

### Balancing Notes
- Common familiars: Easy to get, basic 5-10% bonuses
- Rare familiars: Moderate difficulty, 10-20% bonuses
- Epic familiars: Hard to tame, 20-30% bonuses + unique abilities
- Legendary: Very rare, 30-50% bonuses + game-changing abilities
- Mythic: Ultra-rare, 50%+ bonuses + ultimate abilities

**Power Budget:**
- Combat familiars should deal ~30% of player's DPS at equal level
- Passive bonuses stack additively with other sources
- Utility abilities should save time, not break economy
- Mount speeds: Normal 100% → Common mount 150% → Rare 180% → Epic+ 200%
